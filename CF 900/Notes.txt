B_Array_Reodering

If the value of ai is even, then gcd(ai,2aj) at least 2, regardless of the value of aj.
Therefore, we can put all the even values before the odd ones (it does not matter in what order).Now it remains to arrange the odd values. 
In fact, their order is not important, 
because gcd(ai,2aj)=gcd(ai,aj) (for odd ai and aj). This means that each pair will be considered exactly 1 time,
regardless of the order of the odd elements.
